# Notebooks Directory

## Exploration Notebooks
- **`01_afdb_visualize.ipynb`** - MIT-BIH AFDB (Atrial Fibrillation) database exploration. Visualizes ECG signals, rhythm analysis, frequency domain analysis, and R-peak detection.
- **`01_mitbih_visualize.ipynb`** - MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database exploration. Analyzes beat annotations, class distributions, signal statistics, and arrhythmia patterns.

## Key Features
- **AFDB**: 10-hour records, 250 Hz, rhythm-level annotations (NSR, AF, Other)
- **MIT-BIH**: 30-minute records, 360 Hz, beat-level annotations (N, SVEB, VEB, F, Q)
- Both notebooks include signal visualization, statistical analysis, and frequency domain analysis
- Path issues fixed to work with actual data locations

## Outputs
- **`outputs/`** - Directory for saving analysis results and visualizations
