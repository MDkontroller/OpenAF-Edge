# Source Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains the main source code for the OpenAF-Edge project.

## Status
- Currently minimal
- Contains only `__init__.py` file
- Main dataset implementation moved to `data/dataset.py`

## Structure
- **`__init__.py`** - Package initialization file
- Future modules will be organized here as the project grows

## Note
The core dataset functionality has been implemented in `data/dataset.py` for better organization and direct access.
